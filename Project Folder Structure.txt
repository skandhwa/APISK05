Project Folder Structure 

We are using Maven as build tool
Inside which we have added all the dependencies 
Since we are using maven , the project skeleton is automatically being given 
We have majorly two folders 

src/main/java
Constants --- this will contain a class which is having string as public static final way 
Properties File -----The values are being mentioned in key value pair and then we can use that 

POJO Mapper --- It contains all the POJO classes and then the methods to get and set values are written respectively 


src/test/java 

A folder with resources is created that contains all the feature files
We also have a step definition that implements all the steps and also we have 
used Request and Response based specifications 

Utilities 

Utilities contains all the reusable codes , 
the functions to fetch data from properties . from excel ,from DB 
Everything is mentioned under Utilities 

All the common functions are being present under utilities 
Like Generate Random email , Generate random test data

public static String generateRandomString(int min, int max) {
        String signsSet = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnoprqstuvwxyz";
        char[] chars = signsSet.toCharArray();
        String randString = "";
        Random rand = new Random();
        int length = rand.nextInt((max - min) + 1) + min;
        while (length > 0) {
            randString += chars[rand.nextInt(chars.length)];
            length--;
        }
        return randString;
    }
 
 public static String generateRandomEmail() {
        String str1 = generateRandomString(3, 15);
        String str2 = generateRandomString(3, 15);
        String str3 = generateRandomString(3, 15);
        return String.format("%s.%s@%s.com", str1, str2, str3);
    }
